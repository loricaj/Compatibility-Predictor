# Compatibility-Predictor

I included the json-c library to be able to use the JSON object functions.
I searched through the json-c library documentation and found functions to help me parse the data in the JSON file into my C code.
I initialized various structures inorder to hold the values that I read from the JSON file.
I could not figure out how to obtain the attribute values from the JSON file.
Because the following code relied on the obtaining the attribute values I could not write code to generate the output. I wrote psuedocode in me compPred.c file.
