# Compatibility-Predictor

To run my solution please ensure the compatabilityPredictor.py and data.json file locations are known. My solution takes input from the data.json file. Personally, I have them stored in the same folder which I work in so my command to run the program would be: 

py .\compatabilityPredictor.py .\data.json

Please change directory to files as needed. The output will be presented in json format in the command line. If there are any issues with running the program please let me know, thank you.
